# Cryptobot
Cryptobot is a versatile cryptocurrency bot that is built for both Slack and Discord. There are two different versions, each hosted on a separate branch in this repository.

## Current features
Some of the current features of Cryptobot include:
* Price queries (ex. 'cryptobot what is the price of BTC, LTC, and ETH')
* Automatic price updates based on an "interest list"
* Updates on significant increases/decreases (pumps and dumps)
* Customizable alert + update thresholds/intervals

## Shoutouts
First of all, I'd like to thank both the team at [Discord](//discordapp.com) as well as [Slack](//slack.com) for creating such awesome communication platforms. Even though both have found a niche market, they're both becoming increasingly popular as a casual means of communication - which makes them awesome for chat rooms about cryptocurrency!

I'd also like to thank [hydrabolt](https://github.com/hydrabolt) et al for their hard work on the [discord.js](//github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) Node.js API wrapper for Discord. This project wouldn't be possible without your work!
